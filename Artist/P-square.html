	       Here's a summary of their age, place of birth, and music career:
	       - Age: Peter and Paul Okoye were born on November 18, 1981, which makes them 43 years old.- Place of Birth: 
	       They were born in Jos, Nigeria, but originally hail from Anambra State.
	       - Music Career: P-Square's music journey began while attending St. Murumba College in Jos, 
	       where they joined the school's music and drama club. They started singing, dancing, and mimicking songs by artists
	       like MC Hammer, Bobby Brown, and Michael Jackson. After forming a music and dancing group called "Smooth Criminals" in 1997, 
	       they later won a talent show in 2001, which led to a record deal with Timbuk2 Music Label. They released their debut album "Last Nite" 
                       in 2003, and the rest, as they say, is history.
