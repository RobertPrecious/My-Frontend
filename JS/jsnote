  FUNCTIONS IN JS:

SPC-- Separation of concern
CS-- Code Segregation
int- if u code isnt running ask yourself which part isint running(each code should have its own functions)
keywords or reserved words: 
a. functions

we have:
Required Parameter & Optional Parameter
default value-- saying where we cn declare an optional value
curly braces houses your coded block and it houses ur implementation
function invocation-- if means when we done implementing a code we are calling it back
when u add sth thats not a number to a number except is a string in Javascript is called = NaN

Spread Operator---

steps on knowing what to do in JS:
-- Statement
-- Decision
-- Workflow / Algorithm / Process
